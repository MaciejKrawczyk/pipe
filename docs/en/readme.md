# Introduction
This website was build for a polish company that produces wedding rings. Its main goal was:
- get all orders from clients in one place on a website
- automate production by getting more control over the specific orders in production, order them by dates, parameters, etc.
- sending information in real time to employees currently working on those orders.
- reduce material waste (scraps) by giving each order a QR Code with cutting parameters for CNC machines to scan.

It uses socket.io library, has login/register forms, customizable limited access to routes, jinja template, connection with databse and more.
